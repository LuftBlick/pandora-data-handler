# pandora-data-handler
This repository will implement an utility interface for reading and writing Pandora data in different file formats (Blick, GEOMS, NetCDF, etc).
It will also include functionality to return the data in python in-memory data structures like xarray and pandas dataframes, and handle the writing and reading from a SQL database.
